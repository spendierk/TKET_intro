# TKET Intro

On behalf of [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/), I invite you to explore tools available in [TKET](https://www.quantinuum.com/developers/tket). TKET is one of the leading open-source quantum software development toolkits (SDKs) designed to compile and optimize quantum programs. It is platform inclusive, allowing it to target the worldâ€™s leading quantum hardware, simulators, and other quantum SDKs like Qiskit and PennyLane. It also enhances the performance of other Quantinuum products, such as the quantum computational chemistry and materials science package InQuanto and lambeq, Quantinuum's quantum natural language processing and computational linguistics toolkit. 

The main notebook in this repository called "TKET_intro.ipynb" can be opened in a JupyterHub server.To run the notebook in a browser launch Binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spendierk/TKET_intro_for_qiskit_users/main).

If you want to run the notebook on your machine, please install all Python packages outlined in "requirements.txt" and "apt.txt".


# Quantum Error Mitigation

'''qermit'''  is a python module for running error-mitigation protocols on quantum processors using pytket, the Cambridge Quantum python module for interfacing with CQC TKET, a set of quantum programming tools.
